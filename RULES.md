# Zilch Dice Game Rules

Zilch (also known as Farkle) is a popular dice game of risk and reward. The goal is to be the first player to reach a target score (commonly 10,000 points) by rolling six dice and accumulating points based on specific combinations.

## How to Play

1. **Players**: 2 or more.
2. **Equipment**: 6 standard six-sided dice, paper, and pencil for scoring.
3. **Objective**: Be the first to reach the target score (e.g., 10,000 points).
4. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling all six dice.
   - After each roll, set aside any dice that form scoring combinations (see Scoring below).
   - The player may then either:
     - **Bank** their points for the turn and end their turn, or
     - **Continue rolling** the remaining dice to try to increase their score.
   - If all six dice score in a single turn (a "hot dice"), the player may pick up all six dice and continue rolling.
   - If a roll results in no scoring dice (a "zilch"), the player scores zero for that turn and their turn ends immediately.

## Scoring

Points are scored for specific dice combinations in each roll. Only the dice set aside in each roll count toward the score for that roll.

### Single Dice
- **Each 1**: 100 points
- **Each 5**: 50 points

### Three of a Kind
- **Three 1s**: 1,000 points
- **Three 2s**: 200 points
- **Three 3s**: 300 points
- **Three 4s**: 400 points
- **Three 5s**: 500 points
- **Three 6s**: 600 points

### Four, Five, or Six of a Kind
- **Four of a kind**: Double the points of three of a kind (e.g., four 2s = 400 points)
- **Five of a kind**: Triple the points of three of a kind (e.g., five 2s = 600 points)
- **Six of a kind**: Quadruple the points of three of a kind (e.g., six 2s = 800 points)

### Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6)
- **Straight**: 1,500 points

### Three Pairs
- **Three pairs (e.g., 2-2, 3-3, 4-4)**: 1,500 points

### Two Triplets
- **Two sets of three of a kind (e.g., 2-2-2 and 5-5-5)**: 2,500 points

### Other Rules
- **Hot Dice**: If all six dice score in a single turn, the player may pick up all six dice and continue rolling. There is no limit to how many times this can happen in a turn.
- **Zilch**: If a player rolls and no scoring dice appear, their turn ends and they score zero for that turn.
- **Banking**: A player may choose to stop rolling at any time and "bank" their accumulated points for that turn.
- **Minimum Opening Score**: Some versions require a minimum score (e.g., 500 or 1,000 points) in a single turn to get on the scoreboard for the first time.

## Example Turn
1. Player rolls: 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6
   - Scoring dice: 1 (100), 5 (50), 5 (50) = 200 points
2. Player sets aside the 1 and two 5s, chooses to roll the remaining three dice.
3. Rolls: 2, 3, 4 (no scoring dice)
   - Zilch! Player scores zero for the turn.

## Winning the Game
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score (e.g., 10,000) triggers the final round. Each other player gets one last turn to try to beat the high score.
- The player with the highest score at the end wins.
